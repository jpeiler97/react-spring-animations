# React Spring Animations (React Native)

Animation Demos to practice React Native animation using React Spring

## Features (so far)

### **Simple Dot Spinners**

Self-explanatory, just some basic spinners built using dots. Circle currently has a property for a custom size, same option for the others coming soon.
Prop "type" uses a string to denote which spinner to render.
- Square
- Circle
- Pully
- ZigZag

### **Overlay Spinner**

A wrapper for the Spinner component that renders the spinner on an overlay with a transparent background, which prevents clicking on the screen until the loading prop is set back to false.
